# 📄 Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

An intelligent document processing tool to extract **fillable form-related sections** from PDF files based on semantic analysis, keyword relevance, and refined text extraction — designed for **HR professionals** handling onboarding and compliance workflows.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This solution analyzes a collection of PDFs to identify the most relevant sections and refined content pertaining to **form creation, digital signatures, and PDF interactivity**. It produces a structured `JSON` output optimized for downstream use like automated onboarding, audit readiness, or knowledge extraction.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- **Extracts Relevant Sections**: Based on HR-centric keywords (e.g., *form*, *sign*, *onboarding*)
- **Ranks Content by Relevance**: Using a custom scoring system
- **Outputs Clean JSON**:
  - Top 5 sections with titles and page numbers
  - Top 5 refined text snippets with page context
