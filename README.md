#  Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

An intelligent document processing tool to extract **fillable form-related sections** from PDF files based on semantic analysis, keyword relevance, and refined text extraction — designed for **HR professionals** handling onboarding and compliance workflows.

---

##  Overview

This solution analyzes a collection of PDFs to identify the most relevant sections and refined content pertaining to **form creation, digital signatures, and PDF interactivity**. It produces a structured `JSON` output optimized for downstream use like automated onboarding, audit readiness, or knowledge extraction.

---

##  What It Does

- **Extracts Relevant Sections**: Based on HR-centric keywords (e.g., *form*, *sign*, *onboarding*)
- **Ranks Content by Relevance**: Using a custom scoring system
- **Outputs Clean JSON**:
  - Top 5 sections with titles and page numbers
  - Top 5 refined text snippets with page context

##  Setup & Run

### Option 1: Local Setup

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install pdf-parse
```

#### 2. Prepare Directory Structure

```
mkdir -p collection1_input collection1_output
# Place all PDF files inside collection1_input/
```

#### 3. Provide Input JSON

Edit `challenge1b_input.json` with:

```
{
  "documents": [{"filename": "example.pdf", "title": "Example"}],
  "persona": { "role": "HR professional" },
  "job_to_be_done": { "task": "Create and manage fillable forms for onboarding and compliance." }
}
```

#### 4. Run the Processor

```
node index.js
```

#### 5. View Output

The output will be saved as:

```
collection1_output/final_output.json
```

### Option 2: Docker Setup

#### 1. Configure Collection Paths

Before building the Docker image, update the paths in `index.js` according to your target collection:

Example for collection1
```
const INPUT_JSON_PATH = "./collection1/challenge1b_input.json";
const PDF_DIR = "./collection1/PDFs";
const OUTPUT_DIR = "./collection1";
```

Example for collection2
```
const INPUT_JSON_PATH = "./collection2/challenge1b_input.json";
const PDF_DIR = "./collection2/PDFs";
const OUTPUT_DIR = "./collection2";
```

Example for collection3
```
const INPUT_JSON_PATH = "./collection3/challenge1b_input.json";
const PDF_DIR = "./collection3/PDFs";
const OUTPUT_DIR = "./collection3";
```

#### 2. Dockerfile

```
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY index.js ./

# For collection 1
# RUN mkdir -p /app/collection1/PDFs

# For collection 2
RUN mkdir -p /app/collection2/PDFs

# For collection 3
# RUN mkdir -p /app/collection3/PDFs

RUN chmod +x index.js

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### 3. Build Docker Image

```
# Build for ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t pdf-processor .
```

#### 4. Run Docker Container

**For Collection 1:**
```
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -v $(pwd)/collection1:/app/collection1 pdf-processor
```

**For Collection 2:**
```
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -v $(pwd)/collection2:/app/collection2 pdf-processor
```

**For Collection 3:**
```
docker run --platform linux/arm64 -v $(pwd)/collection3:/app/collection3 pdf-processor
```

##  Output Structure

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "input_documents": [...],
    "persona": "HR professional",
    "job_to_be_done": "...",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-07-28T14:32:30.152468Z"
  },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "document": "...",
      "section_title": "...",
      "importance_rank": 1,
      "page_number": ...
    }
  ],
  "subsection_analysis": [
    {
      "document": "...",
      "refined_text": "...",
      "page_number": ...
    }
  ]
}
```

##  Keywords Used for Extraction

```
form, forms, fillable, interactive, field, fields, onboarding, compliance,
sign, signature, signatures, fill, create, convert, document, documents,
PDF, Acrobat, manage, tools, prepare, export, share, e-signature, workflow,
process, template
```

##  Algorithm Deep Dive

### Section Extraction Strategy
This Node.js solution uses a lightweight scoring algorithm to identify and rank section titles in HR-related PDFs.

**Text Parsing**

- Extracts plain text from PDF using pdf-parse.
- Splits text into lines and analyzes them one by one.

**For each line:**

- Converts text to lowercase.
- Counts keyword matches using regular expressions.
- Increases score proportionally to keyword frequency.

**Section Heading Detection**

A line is considered a possible section title if:
- It starts with a number like 1., 2.1., etc.
- Or has moderate length (between 15–120 characters) and is not too short or too long.

**Ranking Logic**

- Each matched section is assigned a score using scoreContent(line).
- After extraction, sections are sorted by descending score.
- The top 5 sections are retained as final output.

**Page Number Estimation**
Based on the relative line index:

```
page_number = Math.floor(totalPages * (lineIndex / totalLines)) + 1
```

This gives a close approximation of where in the PDF the line appears.

---

## Error Handling & Validation

**Graceful Degradation**
- If a PDF file is missing, it logs a warning and continues with the remaining files.

**Input Validation**
- Ensures lines are not empty before scoring.
- Ignores non-heading and irrelevant sections.

**Output Robustness**
- Automatically constructs output as structured JSON.
- Writes to collection_output/final_output.json.

**Cleanup & Safety**
- No file handles are left open.
- All operations are synchronous or wrapped in async-await for consistency.

---

##  Smart Heuristics

**Detects sections with:**
- No punctuation
- 2–10 words
- Action verbs (e.g., Create, Edit, Convert)
- High keyword overlap

**Filters out:**
- Random sentences
- Captions
- Table data

**Prioritizes:**
- Pages with higher semantic density
- Headings related to persona intent
