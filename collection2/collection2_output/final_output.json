The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDF-signed content.
